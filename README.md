## Key Adaptations

*   **Two-Pass Prediction:** We leverage full contextual information for improved accuracy in Chinese.
*   **Modified Pronoun Lists:** Pronoun lists have been tailored to the nuances of the Chinese language.
*   **Threshold Filtering:** A filtering step is implemented to refine the results and focus on stronger instances of anthropomorphism.
